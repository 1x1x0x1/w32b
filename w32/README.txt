What is w32b?

Im happy to say, that w32 its almost finished, whit a
improved api, less code with much more efficiency.

w32 is still in beta, wait for the full version.

The strongest of the w family so far, it can even
identify the operating system of the devices.

Comes with 3 basic commands:

scan - Starts the scanning.
save-metadata - (still in progress).
exit - Closes the software.

There are 3 more codes to be added, but 
unfortunately they will be exclusive, as they 
will be useful for certain things involving WiFi 
and devices connected to it.

But obviously, it comes with advantages and
disadvantages, one of the main advantages
is its practicality, but a disadvantage is the
scanning time.

There are still small details missing in the w32,
but it is guaranteed that it is almost at its peak
of its power.

it remains open source, but if you make changes,
just don't change the creator of the code ;)
